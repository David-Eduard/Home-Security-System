&nbsp; &nbsp; For this project we used an Arduino Uno microprocessor to which we connected several sensors and implemented everything in a model of a house.

&nbsp; &nbsp; We connected the house to the internet using an ESP8266 module, and then used a keypad and an LCD to enter the code that opens the house and various messages on the LCD.

&nbsp; &nbsp; The next step was to connect a few sensors such as water, gas, motion, fire, to alert the user when there is a problem in the house.

&nbsp; &nbsp; All these messages were received on WhatsApp within 20 seconds of the alert.
